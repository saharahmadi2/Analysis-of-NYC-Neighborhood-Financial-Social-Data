NYC Neighborhood Financial Health Analysis

This project analyzes the financial health of neighborhoods across New York City using Python and object-oriented programming (OOP).
The dataset contains neighborhood-level financial information that helps compare economic conditions across different areas of NYC.

Key factors examined include:

Neighborhood location

Income-related indicators

Financial stability measures

Economic differences across boroughs

The objective of this project is to identify patterns and differences in financial health among NYC neighborhoods.

Project Goals
Understand Neighborhood Financial Conditions

Analyze financial data to see how economic health varies between neighborhoods.

Apply Object-Oriented Programming

Use Python classes and objects to organize data, improve code structure, and make analysis more efficient.

Support Data-Driven Insights

Provide insights that help better understand economic disparities across NYC.

Key Features

Data Organization with OOP: Financial data is structured using Python classes for clarity and reuse.

Comparative Analysis: Compare financial indicators across different neighborhoods.

Clear Insights: Summarize findings to highlight financial strengths and challenges by area.

Results

The analysis highlights clear financial differences between NYC neighborhoods, showing how economic conditions vary across the city.
This project demonstrates how object-oriented programming can be used effectively in real-world data analysis to produce meaningful insights.
